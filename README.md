# Fun_Data_Science_Exploits
This is a repository filled with random mini projects where several different machine learning libraries are implimented. 
Deep Learning in Tensorflow
===========

In this project you use a pre-train CNN created by Google in order to create art with combining two or more images together. The idea is that Deep Dream re-creates the way the brain thnk while on drugs.

Gender Classificaiton with Scikit-Learn
===========

Using basic stats of human, you can train a classifier on in this case 4 different classifiers, compare the learning rates and predict if the person is male or female depending on the input stats.

Genetic Algorithm with TPOT, Numpy, and Pandas
===========

This algorithm tries to learn from past weather data and evolves and learns as time passes in order to improve future outcomes.

Movie Recomemdation System with Numpy, Scipy, and LightFM
===========

This uses movie rating data to give the top 3 choices a user will like watch depending on past movie rating.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Tweepy and TextBlob
===========

This downloads tweets from Twitter and does Sentiment analysis using Textblob via tokenization and outputs probalility relavence to that tweet according to the hash-tag.
